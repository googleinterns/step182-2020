# Libraries

## Getting Started

Over the past 2 weeks, you've learned about client-side HTML and JavaScript, and
server-side Java.

This week, you're going to learn about libraries that provide access to various
features of Google Cloud.

You can return to this walkthrough anytime by running this command:

```bash
teachme ~/step/walkthroughs/week-4-libraries/libraries-walkthrough.md
```

Click the **Start** button to begin!

## Choose a Library

Choose at least two of the following libraries to add to your portfolio.

As you select which libraries to integrate into your portfolio, think about your capstone project and how each of these libraries could add interesting functionality to your project.

### Authentication

Authentication lets users login to your webapp.

Start the authentication walkthrough by executing this command:

```bash
teachme ~/step/walkthroughs/week-4-libraries/authentication/authentication-walkthrough.md
```

### Blobstore

Blobstore lets users upload files like images.

Start the Blobstore walkthrough by executing this command:

```bash
teachme ~/step/walkthroughs/week-4-libraries/blobstore/blobstore-walkthrough.md
```

### Image Analysis (requires Blobstore)

Image analysis allows you to detect the contents of an image.

Since this library requires Blobstore, make sure to complete the Blobstore project first. Blobstore and Image Analysis count as two libraries for our purposes.

Start the image analysis walkthrough by executing this command:

```bash
teachme ~/step/walkthroughs/week-4-libraries/image-analysis/image-analysis-walkthrough.md
```

### Charts

Google Charts allows you to embed an interactive chart in your webpage.

Start the charts walkthrough by executing this command:

```bash
teachme ~/step/walkthroughs/week-4-libraries/charts/charts-walkthrough.md
```

### Maps

Google Maps allows you to embed an interactive map in your webpage.

Start the maps walkthrough by executing this command:

```bash
teachme ~/step/walkthroughs/week-4-libraries/maps/maps-walkthrough.md
```

### Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis allows you to extract information from text.

Start the sentiment analysis walkthrough by executing this command:

```bash
teachme ~/step/walkthroughs/week-4-libraries/sentiment-analysis/sentiment-analysis-walkthrough.md
```

### Translation

Translation allows you to convert text from one language to another.

Start the translation walkthrough by executing this command:

```bash
teachme ~/step/walkthroughs/week-4-libraries/translation/translation-walkthrough.md
```

## Congratulations

<walkthrough-conclusion-trophy></walkthrough-conclusion-trophy>

Congratulations! Your portfolio should now contain a feature that uses a
library! Make sure your
[MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product) works and is
submitted to your GitHub repo by the end of the week.

To start the next set of projects, run the test-driven development intro
