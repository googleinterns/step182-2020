This project uses Blobstore to allow the user to upload an image.

For simplicity it prints HTML directly from `HomeServlet` to demonstrate
constructing a form that submits to the Blobstore URL. This is not how you'd do
this in real life. (See the `hello-world-jsp` and `hello-world-fetch` examples
for more info.)
