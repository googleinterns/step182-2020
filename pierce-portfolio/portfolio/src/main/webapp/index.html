      <p>Hey Team! My name is Pierce Wilson and I'm a '23 at Dartmouth College. I plan to complete a double major in Computer Science &amp Geography, along with a minor in Public Policy.</p>
      <p>Outside of class this year, I wrote new <i>The Dartmouth</i>, America's oldest college newspaper, did research in the African &amp African American studies department, and organized with the fossil fuel divestment campaign. I am really interested in social impact and the nonprofit sector, so I also did some volunteering. </p>
      <p >This is my first 'real' job, but I've held a few different positions in the past. At school this year, I worked as an administrative assistant at the business school, a communications intern in the sustainability office, a notetaker in the Computer Science department. In high school, I worked at the Boys &amp Girls Club, TJMaxx, and A Better Chance (educational access nonprofit). <p>
      <p>In my free time, you can probably find me riding my bike, watching tv, baking, or brewing my own homemade kombucha. Feel free to ask me about any of these things! </p>
