# How to use the Shell Script

1. Cd into bin and enter "./deploy_site [current or existing branch]"
2. Enter in commit message to save current work
**Note**: If nothing is to be saved, then message doesn't matter
3. Confirm merges (ctrl+x if nano is the text editor)
**Note**: If it cannot merge with the master branch, then you will not see the merge step
