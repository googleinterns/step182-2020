      <p>My name is <b>Ikenna Jonathan Elue</b>. I am a male identifying Nigerian American from Chicago who currently attends Northwestern University. In the past, I've worked with Chicago based industries such as JCC Apachi Camp (Jewish Community Center) and ASM (After School Matters). My favorite food is Nigerian jollof rice. I enjoy doing calisthenic based exercises, combination jump roping, and dancing. One non physical activity I enjoy is watching comedy animes or cartoons.</p>
